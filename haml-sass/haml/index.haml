                  Generally regarded as a nice guy, but mysterious. Nobody is ever quite sure what he's doing. He's run the business at a significant profit since its inception, so he must be doing something right.

                  His background is in design, so design always wins over UX or technology. It's rare for him to be involved in day to day operations. His communications are brief. He's not a very good public speaker.
