                  It's great that we offer a 401k, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years. This would really help beef up our retirement funds.

                  Pretty much every policy is unclear because most of them aren't written down. Even if they are, they are rarely followed. What's the point in having rules/guidelines if we're not going to follow them?

                  I think we can do more for our community. I think we all love working here and have stable, happy jobs so I don't want to rock the boat. But I think if we could be more active in the community and with charitable organizations, that would be awesome. Philanthropy is great PR too.

                  In fact, I think we're quite progressive, especially in gender equality. Last time I counted, we have 14 men and 11 women in the company. Nobody expects a perfect balance, but I think we're doing a commendable job of keeping equality a priority within the company at all levels and teams.
