    Amy's been here for about 3 months. So far she's loving it. She's really engaged and likes everyone she's working with.

    She wishes she was working on some bigger accounts, but I let her know this is actually a huge opportunity. The accounts she's been given all have huge potential to be grown. She's definitely excited by that.

    Overall, things are going well!"

    She's happy, and doesn't have any really significant concerns. Granted, she's only 6 months in so that's not too surprising.

    She did ask about what the review cycles were like, and I let her know she'd be up for review in April of 2011. She definitely wants to be an AD, but we'll see if she's ready then."

    She's definitely feeling the heat of the year end rush before we close. Trying to jam in 4 weeks of work into 4 like many of us. So I get to see a new angle of her, and how she deals with really strong time pressures. She's doing fairly well, but you can tell she's frazzled.

    Even this one-on-one felt a little rushed because she wanted to get back to her deliverables. Can't say I blame her, and it's normal.

    Overall though she's happy and doing well. Clients are happy. Her teams performing well."

    It's been a while since we did a formal check in, so that probably didn't help either. We had informal check ins and the annual review, so we've definitely been talking.

    Overall she's still in good spirits, but you can tell she's lost a little of her edge/motivation after not getting promoted. We need to keep her going."

    So while she's still not thrilled (it's been 6 months!), she's still performing admirably and it's not affecting her work outwardly to the client. She's still driving the team internally and the clients are happy.

    She's fine with the less than regular one-on-one's we've been having. She knows that she can talk to me whenever."

    She used this one-on-one time as an opportunity to discuss her successes from the past year. She obviously wants me to be fully aware that she deserves a promotion. :) I think that's fair.

    To be honest, when she laid out her case, while it was a bit forceful, she did make a lot of good points. She's increased revenue by at least 25% on each of her accounts. Clients are happy. Teams are executing.

    I did talk to her a bit about how teams are feeling she's being a little pushy. She agreed and said she will work on how she communicates to them better. "

    Her outlook and morale are definitely higher and she's feeling good. Her work has never really suffered, but anecdotally she is  happier. Her teams reported that she's been less pushy and demanding, and a little softer. Our last conversation hopefully helped.

    We're going into the close of the year, so she knows it's going to get busy. We talked about ways to best get ahead of the year end rush. Best to start spreading it out now and managing client expectations."

    She's happy with where she's at. She admitted her career path from here is not as clear (what's after an AD spot), but I let her know it's something we always keep an eye on and will find something to keep her engaged."

    * Transformed 4 small to medium accounts ($250,000 annually) to large ones (at least $750,000).
    * Has driven her team to be more and more client focused, which has helped to grow the business.
    * Is mentoring other team members within Client Services.

    Doing well...
    * Growing the accounts she has by at least 20% each, driving new projects and business.
    * Clients are happy with her results and personality.
    * Continues to improve her strategic sense to work within her already great tactical skills.

    Needs improvement...
    * Works too much? She rarely switches off, which is great for response times but potentially an indicator for burnout.
    * Needs to be more respectful of the internal team. In her quest for client satisfaction, she sometimes pushes the team too hard."

    Doing well...
    * Just keeps growing business, like a machine. Now up to 25% growth since she took over her accounts.
    * Clients still love her. She wants to try new accounts, and it'll be hard to break her away from the ones that love her.
    * Her strategic sense has vastly improved.
    * Her teamwork is much improved.

    Needs improvement...
    * Still works like a maniac. Hasn't burned out yet, but it's concerning.
    * While her teamwork is much improved, it's still something to keep an eye on as it's in her nature to drive hard."

    She's tried some new established accounts and done OK with those, but not as well as the ones that started small. Still happy with her work and direction, but some of the changes in her environment may not be ideal for her.

    Doing well...
    * Delivers like a machine. Her projects are just about always on time, on budget, with happy clients.
    * Starting to lead by example and mentor more.
    * Taking more time away from work. This is good, she was a little too connected before.

    Needs improvement...
    * Teamwork, again. We've heard feedback that she's using her new title and promotion to really whip people into shape. That's not good news for morale.
    * Adjusting to bigger, already established clients is a little tougher from her (as opposed to growing them herself where she had full control)."
