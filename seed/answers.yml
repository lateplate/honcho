    "Our health benefits are pretty expensive compared to other companies. I have friends who pay half of what we do for similar benefits. Is there anything we can do to lower our rates?"

    "I would love to see more formal financial benefits. As a small, private company, I think we can do some interesting things. I know financials can be a touchy subject, but I think these would be really great to consider...

    * 401k - great tax benefit, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years.
    * Profit sharing - since we're not public we obviously can't have a stock program. But in the same vein, having even a small piece of ownership in the company would be huge."

    "I know this is a stretch...but how about free lunches? A lot of tech companies and agencies do it. Check out how seriously Campaign Monitor takes it! It's a small thing but it's a great way for us to get to know each other better (by eating together), it saves us $8 a day for lunch, and it also saves us time so we can get more done. I see no downsides!"

    "I would love if the company could help to cover commuting costs, whether it be public transportation or even covering the cost of gas. I once did a calculation of "what it costs for me to get to work daily", and it's pretty eye opening.

    To park, take the train, and hop a bus, it costs me $18.50 per day to get to and from work. That's $370 a month...not cheap! I realize this is probably built into our salaries, but it could be a nice additional benefit to consider. Thanks!"

    "I'm not sure if this is a benefit per se, but it would be really cool if we could get a new computer on a regular schedule. Apple comes out with new stuff all the time, so if we could do something like every 18 months that would be awesome.

    Right now, I think the only way we get new machines is if something breaks or if you complain loud enough. If we knew an upgrade was coming on a regular schedule, I bet this would make life easier for our IT department (and fun for us!)"
