    "I would love to see more formal financial benefits. As a small, private company, I think we can do some interesting things. I know financials can be a touchy subject, but I think these would be really great to consider...

    * 401k - great tax benefit, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years.
    * Profit sharing - since we're not public we obviously can't have a stock program. But in the same vein, having even a small piece of ownership in the company would be huge."

I see no downsides!"

    To park, take the train, and hop a bus, it costs me $18.50 per day to get to and from work. That's $370 a month...not cheap! I realize this is probably built into our salaries, but it could be a nice additional benefit to consider. Thanks!"

    Right now, I think the only way we get new machines is if something breaks or if you complain loud enough. If we knew an upgrade was coming on a regular schedule, I bet this would make life easier for our IT department (and fun for us!)"

    * Officially joining a group/cause we believe in. If we committed to attending events regularly, that might help give it a little structure. For example, I know a few of us work with PAWS Chicago. Maybe some of us could volunteer regularly for their adoption events?
    * Matching charitable contributions can make a big difference. A while back Apple announced a program where they would match up to $10k. for every employee, and they raised millions. Obviously we don't have to be at that scale, but every bit helps!"

    I'm a little concerned because in the long run it could prevent us from doing some really amazing things. The design team has a bunch of ideas we want to pursue, but we may not be able to pull them off if the tech team is shorthanded. We need their amazing brains to be fresh to do some of this crazy stuff!

    The cascading effect might be that in the long run our work is good, but not great. And I know we all want to do the best work of our careers. But we need all the teams balanced so there's a harmony among the teams.

    "I know it's difficult to switch accounts around since ADs need to provide continuity across projects. But it would be really great if Jason and I could maybe transition a couple accounts together.

    I think this is not only good for us, but also for the client. The risk/fear is that we'd drop the ball during a transition as well as the relationship that's been built up over time.

    But I think we could also sell the benefits of switching once in a while.

    * A new AD brings a new energy to the team, and in particular, new ideas. Each person has different experience, and having new thinking is always a good thing.
    * We take our relationships seriously, and we're such a small company, none of that will be ever be lost. Jason and I sit 5 feet away from each other. We can always help each other over time.
    * We have different skillsets. Jason is more strategic, but I'm more technical. That could really help extend some of the upcoming work in a new direction."

    The irony is, of course, that if you do good work and you have a vocal client, they want to keep you on the team! There's no getting around this, but I think we should try to build a system that addresses this with clients, because it happens often.

    I also think it would be great if managers could proactively, officially manage this. In other words, if Mark saw that I was on the same client for 6 months that he'd be alerted to it so he could at least check in and see if I was still cool with that. Not sure if a tool like that exists, but it'd be great to be reminded!"

    "Three's a bit much. I think one, maybe two would be good. It's not that it's hard or takes that much time, but I think if we reduced the questions to just one, you may get more (and richer) comments.

    I think with three questions, you may get more just yes/no answers and less people eloborating on their thoughts.

    Plus, you don't know what the question later in the week is going to be. I'd be asking myself, 'which one do I want to invest time in?' Maybe if I knew all the questions at the beginning of the week?

    Plus, I wonder if this is too much information for a manager to take action on. Having just one thing to analyze and address a week is a big task. Three sounds monumental.

    Not complaining -- I actually like answering these. But just trying to think about what most of us need to do that's overhead (questions, timesheets, expense reports, etc.) and keeping it as low friction as possible for everyone."

    I think there are a few things we could do to improve in this area.

    * Make sure we are thinking about analytics and data collection up front, and make sure we insist (even at our own cost) that they be implemented so we can measure.
    * Make sure our strategic choices are backed in data, if possible. We should ask for as much data about their current sites so that we can baseline our future measurements.
    * Scope for time/money post-launch to make sure we do the proper analysis and wrap up to validate (or maybe even invalidate) our strategic thinking. This will be valuable for not only our clients, but for our own post-mortems."

    "Yes, but I think is largely on our team (client services) to manage this as best as we can. Even though our job is to take care of clients, sometimes the best way to take care of them is to not rush work.

    I think we can also do better at managing their expectations around changes. What seems like a small change can affect a lot of things they don't see, which can add to the general sense of being rushed."

  text:
    "I know we're all working a lot, but I think it's important that we think about how great it is to work for a small company. If we doubled in size next week (which I bet we could do), we'd lose a lot of our spirit I think."

    "Being small lets us be nimble and make decisions quicker. Even though being bigger might mean a little less work, I think we'd be spending more time getting consensus than doing great work.

    The counter argument is that with more people, it might free up some of us to do more thinking and less doing. That could really pay off in thought leadership, and really catapult our work to be more innovative.

    Now I'm not sure about my answer!"

    "Right now I think we're just about the right size. I know we're all pretty busy, but overall it feels balanced.

    If anything, I think we might be at a tipping point where if we add 5-10 people, we might be getting a bit big. There's a certain overhead that comes with more people. Sometimes that means more managers.

    It also means we need to sustain a sales pace. We're on a bit of a hot streak right now, but nobody can predict how long we can keep it up. The work definitely tends to be seasonal.

    It's more expensive in the short run, but we may be better off sticking with more freelancers until we see how the year's financials play out."
