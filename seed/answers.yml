    "I would love to see more formal financial benefits. As a small, private company, I think we can do some interesting things. I know financials can be a touchy subject, but I think these would be really great to consider...

    * 401k - great tax benefit, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years.
    * Profit sharing - since we're not public we obviously can't have a stock program. But in the same vein, having even a small piece of ownership in the company would be huge."

    To park, take the train, and hop a bus, it costs me $18.50 per day to get to and from work. That's $370 a month...not cheap! I realize this is probably built into our salaries, but it could be a nice additional benefit to consider. Thanks!"

    Right now, I think the only way we get new machines is if something breaks or if you complain loud enough. If we knew an upgrade was coming on a regular schedule, I bet this would make life easier for our IT department (and fun for us!)"

    * Officially joining a group/cause we believe in. If we committed to attending events regularly, that might help give it a little structure. For example, I know a few of us work with PAWS Chicago. Maybe some of us could volunteer regularly for their adoption events?
    * Matching charitable contributions can make a big difference. A while back Apple announced a program where they would match up to $10k. for every employee, and they raised millions. Obviously we don't have to be at that scale, but every bit helps!"

    I'm a little concerned because in the long run it could prevent us from doing some really amazing things. The design team has a bunch of ideas we want to pursue, but we may not be able to pull them off if the tech team is shorthanded. We need their amazing brains to be fresh to do some of this crazy stuff!

    The cascading effect might be that in the long run our work is good, but not great. And I know we all want to do the best work of our careers. But we need all the teams balanced so there's a harmony among the teams.

    I think this is not only good for us, but also for the client. The risk/fear is that we'd drop the ball during a transition as well as the relationship that's been built up over time.

    But I think we could also sell the benefits of switching once in a while.

    * A new AD brings a new energy to the team, and in particular, new ideas. Each person has different experience, and having new thinking is always a good thing.
    * We take our relationships seriously, and we're such a small company, none of that will be ever be lost. Jason and I sit 5 feet away from each other. We can always help each other over time.
    * We have different skillsets. Jason is more strategic, but I'm more technical. That could really help extend some of the upcoming work in a new direction."

    The irony is, of course, that if you do good work and you have a vocal client, they want to keep you on the team! There's no getting around this, but I think we should try to build a system that addresses this with clients, because it happens often.

    I also think it would be great if managers could proactively, officially manage this. In other words, if Mark saw that I was on the same client for 6 months that he'd be alerted to it so he could at least check in and see if I was still cool with that. Not sure if a tool like that exists, but it'd be great to be reminded!"

    "In general, I feel like our projects give a lot of time to strategy, UX, and design, but short development. So I guess I think we spend too much time on those phases, and not enough in dev.

    Is there a way where we could shorten those other phases, or give it equal balance to dev?"

    "I know I sound like a broken record, but I think we spend too much time designing home pages. I realize it's what clients focus on, but anything we can do to help train clients that there are hundreds of other pages on the site would really help us out in the long run, I think."
