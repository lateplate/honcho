          About
        </h2>
        <p class='description'>
          1917 Design is a creative and technology agency in Chicago. We're a small company of 25 tightly-knit people that care about each other first, and our work a close second.
        </p>
        <p class='description'>
          We love our clients, and they love us back. That's because we value honesty and hard work. That helps us turn a healthy profit so that we can invest in the best people around the world.
        </p>
        <p class='description'>
          You'll never hear us say "end-to-end solutions" or "laser-focused commitmment", because normal people don't talk like that. You're more likely to hear us say "awesome work" and "incredibly proud".
        </p>
        <p class='description'>
          Ever heard such honesty from an agency before?
