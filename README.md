# Honcho Sample Data

This site outlines a fictitious company that can be used as the basis for demonstration data for the Honcho application.

This site includes the following data:
* Brief profiles of the 25 people who make up the company. These profiles help to ensure consistency in how a person might respond to a question. These will also help fill out their profile timeline events.
* 17 sample questions and with corresponding counts of yes/no responses, as well as potential comments from employees.

The site does not currently contain profile timeline events for each person yet.
