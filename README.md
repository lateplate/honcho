# Honcho Sample Data

This site outlines a fictitious company that can be used as the basis for demonstration data for the Honcho application. 

It's built using Haml and Sass. Any content or code changes should be made to the files within the haml-sass folder.

This site includes the following data:
* Brief profiles of the 25 people who make up the company. These profiles help to ensure consistency in how a person might respond to a question. These will also help fill out their profile timeline events.
* 17 sample questions and with corresponding counts of yes/no responses, as well as potential comments from employees.

Note: profile timeline events for each person have not yet been created.
