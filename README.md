# Honcho Sample Data

This site outlines a fictitious company that can be used as the basis for demonstration data for the Honcho application. 

The site is built using:
* Haml
* Sass
* Middleman

Middleman is specifically used for:
* Layouts and templates
* Data via Yaml
* Partials

For the most part, site content will be driven using Yaml files. There may be a few headers and layout specific titles in the pages themselves, but generally most will be from the Yaml files. Those can be found in the "data" directory.

This site includes the following data:
* Brief profiles of the 25 people who make up the company. These profiles help to ensure consistency in how a person might respond to a question. These will also help fill out their profile timeline events.
* 17 sample questions and with corresponding counts of yes/no responses, as well as potential comments from employees.
