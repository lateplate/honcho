                  Our health benefits are pretty expensive compared to other companies. I have friends who pay half of what we do for similar benefits.

                  I would love to see more formal financial benefits. As a small, private company, I think we can do some interesting things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know financials can be a touchy subject, but I think these would be really great to consider:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    401k - great tax benefit, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Profit sharing - since we're not public we obviously can't have a stock program. But in the same vein, having even a small piece of ownership in the company would be huge.

                  Some companies offer discounts at retailers using a group rate. Examples: cell service discounts, Apple Store discounts, travel discounts, etc.

                  It's a small thing but it's a great way for us to get to know each other better (by eating together), it saves us $8 a day for lunch, and it also saves us time so we can get more done. I see no downsides!
                </p>
                <p>
                  If not free lunches, maybe a smaller scale version could be free snacks and drinks?

                  I would love if the company could help to cover commuting costs, whether it be public transportation or even covering the cost of gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I once did a calculation of "what it costs for me to get to work daily", and it's pretty eye opening.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To park, take the train, and hop a bus, it costs me $18.50 per day to get to and from work. That's $370 a month...not cheap!

                  I realize this is probably built into our salaries, but it could be a nice additional benefit to consider. Thanks!

                  I'm not sure if this is a benefit per se, but it would be really cool if we could get a new computer on a regular schedule. Apple comes out with new stuff all the time, so if we could do something like every 18 months that would be awesome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Right now, I think the only way we get new machines is if something breaks or if you complain loud enough. If we knew an upgrade was coming on a regular schedule, I bet this would make life easier for our IT department (and fun for us!)

                  Sorry if this sounds a little morbid, but it'd be great if we could consider a stronger life insurance policy. We have a pretty basic one here, but for those of us with family (especially kids), this is really, really important.

                  I'm not sure if this is a policy question or a benefit question, but I think we could show some serious progress by allowing benefits to be extended to partners, especially in cases where marriage is not allowed by law. :(

                  I've always wondered how we give back to the community, and if we have a matching program for charitable donations. As far as I know we don't have anything official, but I wasn't 100% sure. Some options we could consider:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Officially joining a group/cause we believe in. If we committed to attending events regularly, that might help give it a little structure. For example, I know a few of us work with
                    <a href='http://www.pawschicago.org/' target='_blank'>PAWS Chicago.</a>
                    Maybe some of us could volunteer regularly for their adoption events?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Matching charitable contributions can make a big difference. A while back
                    <a href='http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/08/apple-institutes-new-charitable-matching-program-for-employees/' target='_blank'>Apple announced a program where they would match up to $10k.</a>
                    for every employee, and they raised millions.
                    Obviously we don't have to be at that scale, but every bit helps!

                  Many of our policies are unclear because they tend to be informal. So I think every group runs a little bit differently. That can cause confusion, or even resentment, between teams.

                  Is there an official work from home/remote policy?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know we have some team members that aren't in the Chicago office, and people occassionally work remotely to attend to personal business. But do we have any formal policy that say when you can or can't work remotely?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think most us are pretty responsible, so I'd love if we allowed working remotely at any time without having to clear it with our managers first.

                  Quite the opposite. I love the fact that we don't have very many "official" policies, and that we take responsibility for ourselves. This is a huge, huge reason I wanted to work here. Please don't change it!

                  But I think managers are handled differently. I'd love to have a little more guidance from the executive team on how to improve. I think we could do this by:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Getting ahead of our busy schedules by setting times in advance and not letting client meetings trump our one-on-ones. Let's think of these internal meetings as more important than client meetings. I know that's easier said than done.

                  Unfortunately, yes, the dev team is pulling some pretty long weeks (60 or more hours). I hope we can correct this soon.

                  Yeah, but for me it's less about how many hours of work, and more about if I'm enjoying it. I probably work closer to 50 hours a week, but I'm honestly having a blast so it's not a huge deal for me.

                  It goes in peaks and valleys. But there have been an awful lot of peaks lately, especially with the new biz wins. Seems like we should have more resources available with all this new work coming in?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Specifically I think the tech team is shorthanded. I don't want to speak for them, but they're doing a great job keeping up but I don't know how much longer they can sustain this workload.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm a little concerned because in the long run it could prevent us from doing some really amazing things. The design team has a bunch of ideas we want to pursue, but we may not be able to pull them off if the tech team is shorthanded. We need their amazing brains to be fresh to do some of this crazy stuff!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cascading effect might be that in the long run our work is good, but not great. And I know we all want to do the best work of our careers. But we need all the teams balanced so there's a harmony among the teams.
                </p>

                  Sorry for the long rant! Hope that made sense.

                  I try to stick to a 40 hour week because I think pushing too far past that actually negatively impacts my work. I know opinions vary on this and some people work better powering through.

                  I think it's a personal preference and you need to know what works for you. And most importantly, we should all be open and respectful to different work styles.

                  I know it's difficult to switch accounts around since ADs need to provide continuity across projects. But it would be really great if Jason and I could maybe transition a couple accounts together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think this is not only good for us, but also for the client. The risk/fear is that we'd drop the ball during a transition as well as the relationship that's been built up over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But I think we could also sell the benefits of switching once in a while, like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A new AD brings a new energy to the team, and in particular, new ideas. Each person has different experience, and having new thinking is always a good thing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We take our relationships seriously, and we're such a small company, none of that will be ever be lost. Jason and I sit 5 feet away from each other. We can always help each other over time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We have different skillsets. Jason is more strategic, but I'm more technical. That could really help extend some of the upcoming work in a new direction.

                  I personally have been on the same client for about a year. There have been a variety of projects and they've all been great and interesting. But it would be nice to spread my wings a bit. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  The irony is, of course, that if you do good work and you have a vocal client, they want to keep you on the team! There's no getting around this, but I think we should try to build a system that addresses this with clients, because it happens often.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also think it would be great if managers could proactively, officially manage this. In other words, if Mark saw that I was on the same client for 6 months that he'd be alerted to it so he could at least check in and see if I was still cool with that. Not sure if a tool like that exists, but it'd be great to be reminded!

                  Since the dev team is fairly small, I think we get plenty of variety. In fact, we may have the opposite problem - it might be a good thing if we could focus on just 1 or 2 clients!

                  I think being a small company is a huge benefit in this department. Yes there are a few folks who have to stick on a particular project or client as needed, but most of us float around to different projects as needed.

                <p>
                  The longest I've been on a project has been about 6 months, and even that was an exception, not a rule. I think we do a good job of keeping variety up for most of us.

                  In general, I feel like our projects give a lot of time to strategy, UX, and design, but short development. So I guess I think we spend too much time on those phases, and not enough in dev.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is there a way where we could shorten those other phases, or give it equal balance to dev?

                  I know I sound like a broken record, but I think we spend too much time designing home pages. I realize it's what clients focus on, but anything we can do to help "train" clients that there are hundreds of other pages on the site would really help us out in the long run, I think.

                  Three's a bit much. I think one, maybe two would be good. It's not that it's hard or takes that much time, but I think if we reduced the questions to just one, you may get more (and richer) comments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think with three questions, you may get more just yes/no answers and less people eloborating on their thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plus, you don't know what the question later in the week is going to be. I'd be asking myself, "which one do I want to invest time in?" Maybe if I knew all the questions at the beginning of the week?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plus, I wonder if this is too much information for a manager to take action on. Having just one thing to analyze and address a week is a big task. Three sounds monumental.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not complaining -- I actually like answering these. But just trying to think about what most of us need to do that's "overhead" (questions, timesheets, expense reports, etc.) and keeping it as low friction as possible for everyone.

                  I think we could better serve our clients if we picked a couple technology platforms to really focus in on and build a team around those.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In many of our pitches, we say we're experts in a lot of platforms and languages. That's partially true because many concepts are the same, but it's also very, very hard to execute consistently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall if we had a little more focus on our technology choices, I think we could really be more honest and effective with our clients.

                  I think that selling work when we we're already over capacity, and assuming we'll figure out how to staff it later is really dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the past we didn't really do that. But with the recent win for us in Austin, they're expecting a local team. We knew we didn't have anyone down there yet but we signed the contract anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is this a wise thing to do? I think one of our strongest values is honesty, and I want to make sure we do whatever we can to protect that!

                  We heard from one of our clients that our response time in addressing bugs was a little slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So we installed a support contract with them to be able to turn things around faster and provide some structure to the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, our ability to make fixes hasn't gotten any faster. I don't think we've actually staffed up for it, so now I feel like our client is paying more for the same level of service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'd love to find a way to help staff up so we can be fair with the commitments we've made and keep our clients happy.

                  We talk a lot about strategy and user experience with our clients (quite confidently, I might add) and do a lot of work up front to support this. It's the foundation for our design and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But after we launch, we don't really validate our strategy and measure if what we did worked. We build a really great, visually stunning site, but I don't think any of us are quite sure if it's actually making our clients and their customers happier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think there are a few things we could do to improve in this area:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Make sure we are thinking about analytics and data collection up front, and make sure we insist (even at our own cost) that they be implemented so we can measure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Make sure our strategic choices are backed in data, if possible. We should ask for as much data about their current sites so that we can baseline our future measurements.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Scope for time/money post-launch to make sure we do the proper analysis and wrap up to validate (or maybe even invalidate) our strategic thinking. This will be valuable for not only our clients, but for our own post-mortems.

                  It'd be great if we had a dashboard somewhere that we could all see this. We have so many projects going on at once, it's hard to keep it all in your head, especially for our remote team members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've heard of other companies running a web based dashboard with a visual of what everyone is working on. Not a spreadsheet or report, but a visual where you can quickly tell what's going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would love to work on something like this. We might even be able to make this a product and sell it to our clients.

                  I think it'd be great to know what everyone is working on. I know we're all busy, but it could be helpful to see if two people are working on similar things. We might be able to collaborate across projects and make the work better together.

                  Internally, I think we do a commendable job of recognizing our work in pretty much every group. We have a talent pool second to none and it shows in our work. We have parties for launches, reward those that have gone above and beyond, and generally celebrate our work.

                  <li>
                    We have some killer work and a decent amount of Twitter followers, but I'm not sure we leverage that channel enough. We could promote harder there.

                  <li>
                    I bet if we really pushed hard we could be in the top 10 headlines on Adweek. Don't we have some friends on their editorial staff?

                    HTML5 lets us store data within the browser. A lot of times we don't even need a back end to keep some data and really improve the user experience. This simplifies and speeds up development and could be really cool to try.

                  We tend to rely on our intuition a lot, which generally works OK. But I think we have some opportunities to use data to our advantage. That will give us proof on whether our campaigns are working, and give us great statistics for case studies too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Imagine if we could pinpoint when our campaigns launched, and saw a measurable impact to site traffic. Even better -- what if we could tie sales and revenue back to our campaigns. Right now we kind of guess at this. But advancement in analytics platforms makes all of this very possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's a long term effect here too. If we can tie back data to those events and show success, it makes our new biz pitches that much easier. We can literally say, "Look, our campaign directly resulted in a 25% increase in sales." That's powerful.

                  Yeah, and it's tough. I feel like there aren't enough hours in the day. I think there are a couple reasons for this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We tend to have a lot of meetings. I know they're needed. But for developers these breaks in the day are really disruptive. We tend to work better when we have bigger stretches of uninterrupted time. Kind of hard to explain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Clients make a lot of changes. Not sure there's much we can do about this. But even if we plan out our day, much of it can get shuffled around. I don't have any problem making adjustments, but it does add to the rush some.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  I think the dev timelines are a little short. If there's any way we can make the dev timelines a little longer when we're making our project schedules (even a week), that would be a huge help.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, if there's a way to stagger launches from a client services perspective, that would be HUGE. When we have multiple launches in one week (or even one day!), our hair starts to fall out.

                  Right or wrong, our clients are pretty demanding. We are constantly being asked to shave time off our schedules, even though that does them a disservice. I wish we could show them somehow that we build our schedules with their best intentions in mind!
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're also doing our best to not have too many projects run on the same timelines. Staggering deliverables is something we need to keep an eye on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not sure if it's possible, but if the leadership team could help us manage this with clients, that'd be a huge help. We don't have to tell them our internal reasons, but if we can "convince" them to push a week here, a week there, it could make a big difference to the quality of our work!

                  I do feel rushed, but it's hard not to in a client focused business. In fact, a lot of times the clients are the ones making you feel rushed. "Can you get this to us by end of day?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, it's up to us to manage those expectations. I don't know if there's ever really an occasion where a 4 hour turnaround is reasonable. If we start to set that expectation early on with our clients, I think it helps in the long run.

                  Yes, but it's a client business. All agencies have less time than they want to run a project. The constraints are sometimes a good thing.

                <p>
                  Yes, but I think is largely on our team (client services) to manage this as best as we can. Even though our job is to take care of clients, sometimes the best way to take care of them is to not rush work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think we can also do better at managing their expectations around changes. What seems like a small change can affect a lot of things they don't see, which can add to the general sense of being rushed.

                  Not always, but sometimes I don't know if a client is coming into the office until the last minute. So it can be tough to get the rooms setup with the right stuff (snacks, drinks, whiteboards, etc.) Anything we can do to plan that out better would be really helpful!

                  I know we're all working a lot, but I think it's important that we think about how great it is to work for a small company. If we doubled in size next week (which I bet we could do), we'd lose a lot of our spirit I think.

                  Being small lets us be nimble and make decisions quicker. Even though being bigger might mean a little less work, I think we'd be spending more time getting consensus than doing great work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The counter argument is that with more people, it might free up some of us to do more thinking and less doing. That could really pay off in thought leadership, and really catapult our work to be more innovative.

                  Right now I think we're just about the right size. I know we're all pretty busy, but overall it feels balanced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If anything, I think we might be at a tipping point where if we add 5-10 people, we might be getting a bit big. There's a certain overhead that comes with more people. Sometimes that means more managers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It also means we need to sustain a sales pace. We're on a bit of a hot streak right now, but nobody can predict how long we can keep it up. The work definitely tends to be seasonal.

                <p>
                  It's more expensive in the short run, but we may be better off sticking with more freelancers until we see how the year's financials play out.

                  I think we all feel free to contribute. But sometimes I feel like the dev team doesn't have equal footing with some other teams, so I may bite my tongue from time to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I genuinely appreciate the ideas that everyone has, but sometimes I wish dev ideas carried a little more weight.

                  I'd be surprised if anyone was. Every meeting I've ever been in has been super collaborative, and we all have our own ideas. Your's might not win out, but nobody should be afraid to give out their ideas. Heck, one time I got my dog's picture into some client work!!

                  No, but does it matter? When I think about company vision, it feels very corporate. I may not know our exact line, but I know it's about doing great work and doing it honestly. That's what matters!

                  No, but it really doesn't affect how we work or what we do. I think we all inherently get it, though we may never have to say it out loud.

                    Financials. Not every last detail of how much money everyone is taking home, but are we making a good profit? How does that translate to our salaries and bonuses? We're a small company, I'd like to have a better sense of this.

                    I'd like more insight into how we do our planning. I think transparency here would help us all pull in the same direction. For example:

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      What are the company's priorities for the next 6 months?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Whare are our measures for success? Is it just revenue, or do we have other objective and subjective measures?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Who does all the planning? Can non-management folks be involved, given our size?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Do we ever publish our priorities, as a company, so we can all help to track to them?

                    I think the leadership team has been quite transparent, within reason. Maybe I'm being a little corporate, but I think we need to believe in and trust the leadership to make the right decisions so we can focus on delivery.
