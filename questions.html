                  It's great that we offer a 401k, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years. This would really help beef up our retirement funds.

                  It'd be cool if we could get group discounts on stuff a lot of us buy. Some companies offer cell service discounts or Apple Store discounts. That'd be killer.

                  I've always wondered if we have a matching program for charitable donations. As far as I know we don't but I wasn't 100% sure. It'd be a great way to encourage the team to give back to the community!

                  Quite the opposite. I love the fact that we don't have very many "official" policies, and that we take responsibility for ourselves. This is a huge, huge reason I wanted to work here. Please don't change it!

                  No. We're sort of left to do our own thing. We work hard to push out client deliverables, but we rarely get a thank you from the client. But we always hear about how we messed up.

                  I know I try really hard to let my team know how they're doing. But I think managers are handled differently and have to navigate the water ourselves. I'd love to have a little more guidance from the executive team on how to improve.

                  Yeah, but for me it's less about how many hours of work, and more about if I'm enjoying it. I probably work closer to 50 hours a week, but I'm honestly having a blast so it's not a huge deal for me.

                  Annual reviews and bonuses seems to keep getting pushed back, and this is concerning for a variety of reasons. It gives the appearance that we are in financial trouble, but also that we don't take our individual performances seriously.

                  In fact, I think we're quite progressive, especially in gender equality. Last time I counted, we have 14 men and 11 women in the company. Nobody expects a perfect balance, but I think we're doing a commendable job of keeping equality a priority within the company at all levels and teams.

                  Yes, but it's a client business. All agencies have less time than they want to run a project. The constraints are sometimes a good thing.

                  We tend to rely on our intuition a lot, which generally works OK. But I think we have some opportunities to use data to our advantage. That will give us proof on whether our campaigns are working, and give us great statistics for case studies too.

                  I'd like more insight into our long term priorities. It doesn't have to be a regular thing, but it's easy for us to get stuck in the day-to-day work. What are the company's priorities for the next 6 months, clearly stated?

                  I think the leadership team has been more than transparent, within reason. No company's CFO is going to show you all the details of the finances. You need to believe in and trust the leadership to make the right decisions so we can focus on delivery.

                  I just like to do good work and focus on that. I appreciate the big picture, but try not to concern myself with it too much unless it's going to affect me or my friends here.

                  I think we do a pretty good job of keeping everyone posted on what's going on. Sure it's not every last detail, but we will always be honest with everyone. This company is built on honesty.
