                  It's great that we offer a 401k, but it's disappointing that we don't have a matching program. Many companies match up to 5%, and allow employees to vest after a few years. This would really help beef up our retirement funds.

                  It'd be cool if we could get group discounts on stuff a lot of us buy. Some companies offer cell service discounts or Apple Store discounts. That'd be killer.

                  I've always wondered if we have a matching program for charitable donations. As far as I know we don't but I wasn't 100% sure. It'd be a great way to encourage the team to give back to the community!

                  Do we allow dogs in the office? I've never seen one, but there are so many animal lovers in the office this could be really cool! I know some people think they could be a distraction, but I've seen them at other offices and they really help bring people together!!!

                  Pretty much every policy is unclear because most of them aren't written down. Even if they are, they are rarely followed. What's the point in having rules/guidelines if we're not going to follow them?

                Quite the opposite. I love the fact that we don't have very many "official" policies, and that we take responsibility for ourselves. This is a huge, huge reason I wanted to work here. Please don't change it!

                I'm a fan of a lot of work that's out there, our's included. I think it can be dangerous to get sucked into what's cool and hot, and wishing we had been a part of it.

                No. We're sort of left to do our own thing. We work hard to push out client deliverables, but we rarely get a thank you from the client. But we always hear about how we messed up.

                I know I try really hard to let my team know how they're doing. But I think managers are handled differently and have to navigate the water ourselves. I'd love to have a little more guidance from the executive team on how to improve.

                  The dev team is regularly pulling 60 hours weeks, usually because designs or functionality have changed at the last minute. Not sure how much longer we can keep this up.

                  Yeah, but for me it's less about how many hours of work, and more about if I'm enjoying it. I probably work closer to 50 hours a week, but I'm honestly having a blast so it's not a huge deal for me.

                  Seriously? Yes. We spend inordinate amounts of time designing every last detail of a home page, and forget about designing the rest of the site. We have weeks and weeks of design concepting, and then about 4 weeks to code 500 pages. You do the math.

                  Annual reviews and bonuses seems to keep getting pushed back, and this is concerning for a variety of reasons. It gives the appearance that we are in financial trouble, but also that we don't take our individual performances seriously.

                In general I feel like the important stuff is taken care of. Sure thare are things that slip, but that happens everywhere. I think the team is doing a good job of taking care of what matters.
